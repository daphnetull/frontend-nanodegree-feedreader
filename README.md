## Overview

This project demonstrates knowledge using the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework.  In this case, it's on a simple prebuilt web application that reads RSS feeds.    

Udacity supplied the [index.html](index.html), the [style.css](css/style.css), and the [app.js](js/app.js) files.  The test suites in [feedreader.js](jasmine/spec/feedreader.js) were written by Daphne Tull.

## Tests Written

* RSS Feeds are defined
* URL and names of every RSS feed is defined and not empty
* Menu element is hidden by default
* Menu changes visibility when menu icon is clicked
* When feed loads, it contains at least one item
* Content changes when a new feed is loaded
